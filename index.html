    </div>
    <h2>Strengths:</h2>
    <oi>
        <div class="box"><li>Versatility: Saka's ability to play in multiple positions is one of his biggest strengths. He is comfortable playing as a winger on either side of the pitch, as well as a left-back. His versatility allows his team to switch formations and adjust to the opposition's tactics, making him a valuable asset.</li></div>
        <div class="box"> <li>Dribbling: Saka has excellent dribbling skills and is very comfortable running with the ball at his feet. He has a low center of gravity, making it difficult for defenders to dispossess him.</li></div>
        <div class="box"><li>Crossing: Saka is an excellent crosser of the ball. He has good vision and is able to pick out his teammates with accurate crosses from wide positions. His crosses often create goal-scoring opportunities for his team.</li></div>
        <div class="box"> <li>Work-rate: Saka has a high work-rate and is constantly pressing and harrying his opponents. He is willing to track back and help his defenders when his team is under pressure.</li></div>
    </oi>
    
    <h2>Weaknesses:</h2>
    <oi>
        <div class="box"> <li>Finishing: Saka's biggest weakness is his finishing. While he is an excellent crosser of the ball, his finishing needs improvement. He tends to miss good scoring opportunities, and his shots often lack power and accuracy.</li>

        </div>
        <div class="box"> <li>Defensive positioning: While Saka is comfortable playing as a left-back, his defensive positioning needs improvement. He can sometimes get caught out of position, leaving gaps for the opposition to exploit.</li>
        </div>
        
    </oi>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p> Overall, Bukayo Saka is a talented young player with many strengths, but there are still areas of his game that need improvement. With the right guidance and coaching, he has the potential to become a top-class player.</p></div>
